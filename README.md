# Knight Travails

## Overview 

The Knight Travails project is a JavaScript implementation that finds the shortest path for a knight on a chessboard using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. 
The solution efficiently explores all possible knight moves to determine the minimum number of moves required to reach a target position from a starting position.
